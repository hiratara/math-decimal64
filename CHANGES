0.07
 - Add unpack() and associated subs.

0.06
 - Fix t/conv_math_mpfr.t to cater for the case that Math::MPFR loads but is an older
   version that doesn't provide the Math::MPFR::_MPFR_WANT_DECIMAL_FLOATS function.
 - Define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT.
 - Add metadata to Makefile.PL.
 - Work around compiler/libc bug in handling of the value 897e-292. (Affects PPC only.)

0.05
 - Fix D64toME() so that it works correctly on powerpc processors.
 - Add FR64toME and pFR.
 - Document LDtoD64 and D64toLD.
 - Add assignInf, assignNaN, assignPV.
 - Allow overloaded operations to accept integers (IV/UV).
 - Alter the way that strEQ gets hold of HvNAME(SvSTASH(SvRV(sv))) - so that -Wall
    doesn't emit "null argument" warnings. (Thanks Daniel Kahn Gillmor.)
 - Have only *one* NaN ( = inf/inf). Originally we could also set NaN to -(inf/inf),
   but this is stupid and can cause problems.

0.04
 - Fix bugs in t/lengthy_mantissa.t. (A '-' in a regex needed to be escaped.)
   Also the precise number that appears in $@ for test 3 will vary, depending
   upon nvsize. (Test 3 modified to accommodate this.)

0.03
 - Add LDtoD64 and D64toLD (conversions between Math::LongDouble and
   Math::Decimal64 objects).

0.02
 - Small change to _sci2me() to avoid 'uninitialized' warnings on 5.10 (and
   perhaps earlier).

   Replace 'exp10' (which already exists in at least some C libraries)
   with Exp10.

0.01
 - First release.
